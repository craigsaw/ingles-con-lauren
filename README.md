# Inglés con Lauren
### Summary

Inglés con Lauren is a scrolling static website built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and AngularJS.  The layout is designed to be fully-responsive on all device sizes.

I chose to make the site a single scrolling page to best accommodate the content (which I wrote and organized in coordination with the client). For the scrolling function, I used Bootstrap's Scrollspy coupled with JavaScript functions to accommodate the offset of the fixed navbar and to make the page slide smoothly to different sections when a nav tab was clicked.
