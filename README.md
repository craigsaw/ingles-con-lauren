This is the site I created as my final project for Code Louisville's Front-End Web Development track, January 2016. 

It is a promotional site for my sister who teaches private English classes in Argentina.  She didn't have a site prior to this, so I also wrote the content for it.  The main banner on the page was created by a graphic designer in Argentina named Diego Cuellar.

In order to fulfill the Code Louisville requirements, the site had to include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a callback function (I created a little Spanish-English Translator that talks to the Google Translate API), a JavaScript Framework (I chose Angular), and it needed to be responsive to multiple screen sizes (using media queries).

I chose to make the page one scrolling html page because there wasn't enough content to justify using multiple pages.  I used Bootstrap's Scrollspy for the scrolling function.

The philosophy section of the page is where I implemented Angular.  I didn't have any real need to use it other than meeting all of the requirements, so I created a little button-push widget that contains information about my sister's teaching philosophy.

The submit form doesn't yet work (PHP is the next class I'll take), so I had a bootstrap modal pop up upon clicking the submit button, to tell the user that the form doesn't work, and they should send an email instead.

I am going to leave this repository as it is as an artifact for myself; the actual site that will be live on the internet will be a cloned and modified version of this one, in Spanish.
