This is website for a woman who teaches private English classes in Argentina. 

The main banner on the page was created by a graphic designer in Argentina named Diego Cuellar.

Fully responsive layout on all device sizes.

Bootstrap's Scrollspy powers the scrolling function on the page.

The button-push widget in the philosophy section implements an angular framework, albeit a frivolous implementation.
